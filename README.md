# <Bootcamp Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This webpage is a studying tool to record notes on the topics we have discussed so far. The purpose of this project is to 
assist students in remembering important factors of each of the listed topics, as well as provide a suggestion on which 
topics should be focused on. Having an easily accesible place to store your notes allows you to study from anywhere which
is intended to cut down on the stress of a bootcamp student. In making this I have learned the importance of each language
in the process of building something an end user can properly interact with while being visually appealing.
